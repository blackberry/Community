This is a single-table version of [All Repos].
It provides sortable table with all the repositories in our [GitHub Organization](http://github.com/blackberry),
generated from a [JSON file](All_Repos.json).  Also see the list of [All Samples].

The table can be sorted on one or more columns.  To select additional
columns select the next column while pressing the 'SHIFT' (on mac) key.

The table uses the following tooltips:
<span class="question" tip="(Repo column) A list of 'tags' characterizing this repo (useful?)">T</span>, 
<span class="question" tip="(Repo column) Extra information on the branches in the repository">B</span>,
<span class="question" tip="(Repo column) Repo has Pages">P</span>,
<span class="question" tip="(Repo column) Repo has a Wiki">W</span>,
<span class="question" tip="(Desc column) Extra details on the repository">?</span>,
<span class="warning" tip="(Desc column) Issues to resolve">!</span>,
<span class="question" tip="(in BB10 column) Ported to PlayBook but not yet tested on BB10">?</span>
and
<span class="question" tip="(in Port column) Extra information on porting">P</span>.

We welcome your feedback on how to best present information on our Repositories.
