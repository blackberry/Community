## BB10 WebWorks Extensions

Exposing native BlackBerry 10 APIs and porting BBOS extensions for BB10 WebWorks. These extensions are written in C/C++ and JavaScript. See below for our top requests and a link to the Github Issue that tracks development progress. If you have a need for an extension, please open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs/issues) with a description of what you need from the extension. Or, respond on the issue for the extension you need so we can track demand.

__Top Extension Requests__

####1 [Screen Backlight Extension](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs/issues/125) <br>
_Under investigation by Developer Relations for technical feasibility_<br>
Need an extension that will enable an application to keep the backlight on when needed. Investigation will need to be done to see if this is possible in an extension or if it requires changes in the Web Platform itself.

####2 [Barcode Scanning Extension](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs/issues/109) <br>
_needs a volunteer_<br>
Create an extension that can be used to scan barcodes using the ZXing library in BB10. We have some Barcode Scanning code that should be a good starting point.

####3 [Child Browser Extension](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs/issues/126) <br>
_needs a volunteer_<br>
A more extensive Child Browser extension is needed for some use cases. Ideally, this extension would meet the API requirements of the Cordova API so that the code can be reused.

####4 [Bluetooth Extension](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs/issues/127) <br>
_needs a volunteer_<br>
An Extension is needed for WebWorks that would allow search and discovery of Bluetooth devices, connecting, and communication over Bluetooth.

__Other Extension Development__

[Secure One Way Encryption Extension](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs/issues/124)<br>
_needs a volunteer_<br>
We want to create an extension that wraps the code in this sample: <br>[https://github.com/blackberry/Cascades-Community-Samples/tree/master/PasswordSample](https://github.com/blackberry/Cascades-Community-Samples/tree/master/PasswordSample)

[Microphone Recording Extension](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs/issues/110) <br>
by [John852](https://github.com/john852)<br>
_code is complete but not on Github yet_

[Zip/Unzip Extension](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs/issues/104)<br>
Unzip portion done by [Starpax](https://github.com/starpax).<br> _Needs a new volunteer to take on the zip portion_
