Torch Mobile was an early participant in the Webkit community.
RIM acquired Torch Mobile in XXX and RIM first used it in its BB6 smartphones.
During DevCon 2010 America, RIM indicated a commitment to re-engaging in the Webkit community
and it started delivering on that promise in the Spring of 2012.

Snapshots of the sources used in the BB Smartphones and in the PlayBook are in the

and
[WebWorks-PlayBook](http://github.com/blackberry/Webkit-Playbook)
repositories.
