### Description

Currently the runtime for BlackBerry WebWorks on the BlackBerry smartphones is based on Java while
that for the BlackBerry PlayBook is based on Adobe AIR.
WebWorks is fully Open Sourced and is developed transparently.
The implementation for BlackBerry Smartphones was open sourced at DevCon 2010 America ([Blog](TBD))
and the components and tools have followed since.

WebWorks is aligned with [Apache Cordova](Apache_Cordova.html).

WebWorks is the main way to deliver [WebGL](WebGL.html)-based applications.
