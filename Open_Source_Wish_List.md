### Description
This page maintains a Wish List for porting of Open Source Components to help the BlackBerry
Developer Community.

If you have a suggestion, please modify the table 
on the <a href="{{ site.stage }}{{ page.url | replace:'.html','.md' }}" target="_blank">Source Page</a>
using the in-browser edit facility, see [Help Page](other/Quick_Edit.html).
Add the name of the component, a link to the main entry point, the License, and your name, including
the use case. If the component already exists, consider adding your name; the more names, the
higher a priority we will give to the request.

This list is *not* exhaustive and it does not include
many components that are being ported right now, by RIM and non-RIM developers.
