### Description

A Web Launcher is a basically a bookmark that opens a browser on a given URL.
Web Launchers have been around since at least [Active Desktop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Desktop) in Windows 98.

Web Launchers are supported in both BlackBerry OS 5, 6 and 7, and on BlackBerry PlayBook and BlackBerry 10.
