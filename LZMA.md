### Description
[LZMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZMA) is a lossless data compression algorithm first used in the
[7z](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZMA) format. The liblzma implementation is from [XZ Utils](http://tukaani.org/xz).

liblzma is used in a number of applications, including [OpenTTD];
see the instructions in the
[lzma directory](https://github.com/blackberry/OpenTTD/tree/master/3rdparty/lzma)
for how to use it.
The specific version used there is xz-5.0.3, but more recent versions should also work.
