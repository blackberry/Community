### Description
A list of the questions that we want to capture in the Wiki pages, or
questions related to the operation of the Open Source Projects or Community,
or to the Community Wiki itself.

### Open Source Projects

**Q.** Should we create branches at beta releases  
**A.** No, just in stable GA releases (see the approach used by [JDE-Samples][repo:jde-samples].

**Q.** Should we create tags at beta releases  
**A.** That is a reasonable approach, but it's up to the owner of the repository
