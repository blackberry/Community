### Description
HTML5 ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [whatwg.org](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/),
[W3C](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5))
is our core Web platform.
Key pieces in the BlackBerry Platforms are:
 * A very high performance and high quality browser based on [Webkit]
 * A [WebGL] Implementation
 * The [WebWorks] framework, which is related to and in increased alignment with [Apache Cordova]
 * [AliceJS] - a micro JavaScript library that helps leverages hardware-accelerated implementations of CSS3
 * [bbUI.js][bbuijs] - a JavaScript toolkit that implements BlackBerry UI look and feel for WebWorks applications

### HTML5 Compatibility

The BlackBerry browser has consistently delivered high performance and high fidelity ([1]).
