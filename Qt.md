### Description
Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for developers using C++ or QML, a CSS & JavaScript like language.
[Cascades] leverages the Qt object model, event model, and threading model, using
QtCore, QtXML, QtSql, QtNetwork and QtSensors.
The [Cascades] UI elements are available through C/C++ bindings and using [QML].
