* On Flat vs Structured arrangement
** Having multiple subdirectories makes cross-links (from pages in different subdirectories) more complicated and unstable.
** A better solution might be to use a "category" and group pages by category
** Exception might be FAQ (?)

Categories:
  people, product, organization

This might be addressed by the answer to 01 above where the reference is unique but the location varies

If we can do that, one approach is
  people/
  component/
  product/
  faq/

One example of a benefit of the separation is that it means we don't have to be exhaustive in people.

Maybe some links can even go out of the site?
