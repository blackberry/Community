### Description

APIs to use the Camera on BlackBerry 10

### Documentation

* [Online Reference](https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/native/beta/reference/com.qnx.doc.camera.lib_ref/topic/overview.html)

The main forum for questions depends on the software stack being used:

* [Native SDK](http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Native-Development/bd-p/native_sdk)
* [Cascades](http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Cascades-Development/bd-p/Cascades)
* [WebWorks](http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Web-and-WebWorks-Development/bd-p/browser_dev)

### Samples

**[HelloCamera](http://github.com/blackberry/Cascades-Community-Samples/tree/master/HelloCamera)**  
Shows how to set up a Cascades foreign window and connect the Camera viewfinder to it.

**[NativeCamera](http://github.com/blackberry/Cascades-Community-Samples/tree/master/NativeCamera)**  
Shows how to set up a Camera viewfinder in a non-cascades environment using libscreen.

**[HelloVideoCamera](https://github.com/blackberry/Cascades-Community-Samples/tree/master/HelloVideoCamera)**  
Shows how to record videos using the Camera.
This sample is based on the HelloCamera sample so it also illustrates how to set up a Cascades foreign window and connect the Camera viewfinder to it.

**[Photobomber](https://github.com/blackberry/Cascades-Samples/tree/master/photobomber)**  
A camera application that let's you take photos and then have them "bombed" by somebody.  The app shows how to use the
Cascades multimedia library with Camera, take a picture, manipulate the image, and add an image over another image.
