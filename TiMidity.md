### Description
TiMidity
([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiMidity++),
[WebSite](http://sourceforge.net/projects/timidity))
is a software synthesizer that can play MIDI files without a hardware synthesizer.

TiMidity is used in [OpenTTD] and the [GitHub Repo][repo:openttd] has instructions and a very simple patch
to port it on the BlackBerry PlayBook.  Instructions are in the
[timidity](https://github.com/blackberry/OpenTTD/tree/master/3rdparty/timidity)
directory of the repository.
