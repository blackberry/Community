There are many ways to contribute.

### Advertise the Wiki

We want to make this Wiki the main community-created entry point for developers.  Help us advertise it.

### Improve its Quality

If you believe there are errors in the content of a page, file a
[content Issue](https://github.com/blackberry/Community/issues?labels=content) on the main repository.

Infrastructure problems are more nuanced, so we record them against the
[Staging Repository](https://github.com/blackberry-community/Community/issues?labels=content).

### Fix Existing Pages

The Wiki uses [GitHub Pages](http://help.github.com/pages/); the content itself is hosted in the *gh-pages*
branch of the [Community](https://github.com/BlackBerry-Community/Community/tree/master) repo.
We prefer submissions via a GitHub [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).

If your change is a simple edit, you should be able to use Inline Editing, see our [QuickStart](QuickStart.html) page.

### Create New Pages

For substantial changes and for new content, you will need to use Git and GitHub to create and test your contribution;
see [QuickStart](QuickStart.html) for details.

Pages are written using one of these layouts:
* [Basic](example-basic.html)
* [Component](example-component.html)
* [Technology](example-technology.html)
* [FAQ](example-faq.html)
* [People](example-people.html)

You can create a new page by copying and then editing one of the above example pages.

### Contribute Articles

We also support longer articles.  Read the [Current List](../articles/All_Articles.html) to get
some context.

### Submit News

We encourage you to submit news on the community.  Check the [instructions](../news/Submit_News.html)

### Become a Core Member

Finally, we welcome community members that have shown commitment to this wiki effort to become members of our core group.
