There are many ways to contribute

### Advertise the Wiki

We want to make this Wiki the main community-created entry point.  So, help us advertise it

### Improve the Wiki

If you see a page that needs fixing, file an Issue with a
[content](https://github.com/blackberry-community/Community/issues?labels=content) label.

### Provide New Content

The Wiki uses the Pages machinery from GitHub; the content itself is hosted in the *gh-pages*
branch of the [Community](https://github.com/BlackBerry-Community/Community/tree/master) repo.
We prefer submissions via a GitHub [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).

We provide examples for all layouts, so you can copy and start editing:
* [Basic](example-basic.html)
* [Component](example-component.html)
* [Technology](example-technology.html)
* [FAQ](example-faq.html)
* [People](example-people.html)

If you are new to Git or GitHub, check out [QuickStart](QuickStart.html) Page.

### Become a Core member of this Community Wiki effort

Finally, we welcome community members that have shown commitment to this wiki effort to become members of our core group.
