The __developer/contributor-facing__ branch is the
[master branch](https://github.com/pelegri/Community/tree/master).

You are currently in the gh-pages branch which is the __user-facing__ view.  The files here include
the pages holding the actual content plus the layout/include pages.

To simplify casual contributions, this repository includes a set of __examples__, one per layout:

* [basic](example-basic.html)
* [component](example-component.html)
* [faq](example-faq.html)
* [people](example-people.html)
