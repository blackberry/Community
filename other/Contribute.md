There are many ways to contribute

### Advertise the Wiki

We want to make this Wiki the main community-created entry point.  So, help us advertise it

### Improve its Quality

If you see a page that needs fixing, file an Issue with a
[content](https://github.com/blackberry-community/Community/issues?labels=content) label.

### Fix Existing Pages

The Wiki uses [GitHub Pages](http://help.github.com/pages/); the content itself is hosted in the *gh-pages*
branch of the [Community](https://github.com/BlackBerry-Community/Community/tree/master) repo.
We prefer submissions via a GitHub [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).

If your change is very simple, you might be able to use Inline Editing, see [QuickStart](QuickStart.html).

### Create New Pages

Pages are written using layouts.  We provide examples that you can  copy and start editing:
* [Basic](example-basic.html)
* [Component](example-component.html)
* [Technology](example-technology.html)
* [FAQ](example-faq.html)
* [People](example-people.html)

If you are new to Git or GitHub, check out [QuickStart](QuickStart.html) Page.

### Become a Core Member

Finally, we welcome community members that have shown commitment to this wiki effort to become members of our core group.
