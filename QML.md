### Description
QML ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QML), [docs](http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/4.8/qdeclarativeelements.html))
is a JavaScript-based, declarative language for designing user interfaceâ€“centric applications.
It is part of [Qt] and it is used by [Cascades].

The Cascades [Reference pages](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/reference)
describe the elements available to a developer, including both the C/C++ bindings and the QML details.
See for example [Button](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/reference/bb__cascades__Button.html).
