## BlackBerry 10 Jam

The first [BlackBerry 10 Jam](http://www.blackberryjamconference.com/) was in Orlando, California, May 1-3, 2012.
The event happened at the same time as [BlackBerry World](http://www.blackberryworld.com/) (a non-developer conference),
and it included a preview of some of the BlackBerry 10 features and the [BlackBerry 10 Dev Alpha](http://devblog.blackberry.com/2012/05/what-is-blackberry-10-dev-alpha/).

A full list of BlackBerry 10 Jam sessions is at the
[Session Catalog](https://bbworld.blackberryconferences.net/2012/scheduler/newCatalog.do).
If you attended, you can get at the recordings
from the [Conference Portal](https://bbworld.blackberryconferences.net/2012/portal/myPortal.ww).
