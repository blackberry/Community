One more leg in the journey of TunnelTilt -
[From GitHub to your PlayBook](http://openbbnews.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/tunneltilt-github/)...
but now going through the BlackBerry App World:

More details in the official announcement in the [DevBlog post](http://devblog.blackberry.com/2012/03/download-tunneltilt/).

You can preview the game in two ways: check this
[YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxazzRLa0qQ),
or point a modern browser to the
[Demo Page](http://blackberry.github.com/WebGL-Samples/tunneltilt/).
The PlayBook 2.0 browser has WebGL support and will run the demo page but we disabled screen
rotations to avoid triggering a landscape/portrait rotation and you will need to use
touch instead to dodge the obstacles - which is much less fun.
