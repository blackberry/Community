[Joe Mason](http://twitter.com/joenotcharles)'s changes to libcurl have been accepted.  They provide a new auth callback
and should be integrated in a [future release](http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-05/0138.html).  This is a good example
of how contributing directly to the community is a win-win for all involved parties.
