[Cliff Hung] has ported libQREncode, FUKUCHI's very popular, C-based, [QR Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code) encoder
([website](http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html)).  The new
[libQREncode](https://github.com/blackberry/libqrencode) repo is a fork of
[FUKUCHI's repo](http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html).
