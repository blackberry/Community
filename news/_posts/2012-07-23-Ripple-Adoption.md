{% include posts-defs.md %}

The adoption of [Ripple](http://github.com/blackberry/ripple-ui) has two recent very visible examples in
the [PhoneGap Emulator](http://emulate.phonegap.com/), a prototype from Adobe, and in
the [Web Simulator](https://01.org/web-simulator/about) used in
Tizen ([website](https://www.tizen.org/),[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen)).
The main developers participating in these projects continue to cooperate in
Apache Cordova; see [Gord's mail](http://markmail.org/message/i6urugruobtql5m3).
