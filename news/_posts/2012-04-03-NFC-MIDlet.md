[Martin Woolley](https://github.com/mdwoolley) and
[John Murray](https://github.com/jcmurray)
have added a
[MIDlet](https://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-Java/tree/master/NFC/NfcMidlet2)
which illustrates the combined use of TransactionListener and
PushRegistry for receiving
[NFC](http://www.nfc-forum.org/)
transaction event notifications.
