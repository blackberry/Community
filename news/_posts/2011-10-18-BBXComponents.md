Today [Research in Motion](http://rim.com) announced its Native Open Source Components Initiative at DevCon 2011 America. RIM is contributing initial ports of commonly used Open Source Libraries and Games to the QNX-based BlackBerry&copy; Tablet OS, to be used in conjuction with the [BlackBerry Native SDK for Tablet OS](http://developer.blackberry.com/native) (NDK). Following this release, RIM will collaborate with the existing open source communities to incorporate these changes into the upstream repositories.

The initial set of components include Media ([OpenAL](/ndk/components.html#OpenAL), [ALUT](/ndk/components.html#ALUT), [SDL](/ndk/components.html#SDL)), Gaming ([Box2D](/ndk/components.html#Box2D), [Bullet](/ndk/components.html#Bullet), [Cocos2D-X](/ndk/components.html#Cocos2D-X), [OpenTTD](/ndk/components.html#OpenTTD), [DosBox](/ndk/components.html#DosBox), [Wesnoth](/ndk/components.html#Wesnoth)), and General Libraries ([Qt](/ndk/components.html#Qt), [Boost](/ndk/components.html#Boost), [Lua](/ndk/components.html#Lua), [PCRE](/ndk/components.html#PCRE), [Erlang-OTP](/ndk/components.html#Erlang-OTP), [SpiderMonkey](/ndk/components.html#SpiderMonkey). Also released were two components authored by RIM: [GamePlay](/ndk/components.html#GamePlay) - a gaming framework - and [TouchControlOverlay](/ndk/components.html#TouchControlOverlay) - to map touch to mouse / keyboard events.

This is an ongoing initiative; additional compoments will be released as they become available.
