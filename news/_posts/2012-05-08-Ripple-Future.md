{% include posts-defs.md %}

Ripple is developed at our [GitHub organization](http://blackberry.github.com/)
and in recent releases we had been using two separate repositories:
[Ripple-Framework](https://github.com/blackberry/ripple-framework)
and
[Ripple-UI](https://github.com/blackberry/ripple-ui).
Starting with this release we are going
[“back to the future”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future)
and Ripple is, again, a Chrome Browser Extension, which does
not require the Ripple-Framework repository.
