[@LaurenceMuller](http://twitter.com/LaurenceMuller)
has been working on a port of OpenFrameworks for PlayBook to port [NodeBeat](http://nodebeat.com/).
The port is now solid and NodeBeat is available at
[AppWorld](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/106167/?lang=en)
- and Laurence says he
[already has it running on BB10](http://twitter.com/#!/LaurenceMuller/statuses/198801030207643648).

The port is a good example of the collaboration across open source communities; check out:

The latest summary of the port is at
[MultiGesture/ofxQNX](http://www.multigesture.net/projects/ofxqnx/).
The code itself is at GitHub in the
[developPlayBook branch](https://github.com/falcon4ever/openFrameworks/tree/developPlayBook)
of the
[falcon4ever/OpenFramework](http://github.com/falcon4ever/openFramework)
repo, and it includes
[examples](https://github.com/falcon4ever/openFrameworks/tree/developPlayBook/examples/qnx).
Laurence indicated that he hopes to upstream the changes at some point.
