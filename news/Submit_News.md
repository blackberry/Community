You can submit news for the [Latest Community News](Latest_News.html) page
by editing directly the corresponding [markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) page,
[Latest_News.md](http://github.com/blackberry-community/Community/news/Latest_News.md).

You will need to login into GitHub, but you can use
GitHub's inline visual file editing (\[[1]\], \[[2]\], \[[3]\]).

[2]: <https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button> "Forking with the Edit Button"
[3]: <https://github.com/blog/905-edit-like-an-ace> "Edit Like an Ace"

Use the template at the bottom of this page and replace the fields as appropriate,
then place your submission at the top of the Latest_News.md page so the latest news show first
and save your changes.

Behind the covers, GitHub will create a fork, do a commit and issue a pull request.
If you have push rights on this repository the change will apply immediatedly.
If not, a community editor will review and accept your contribution.

Community editors will regularly review the Latest_News page,
will create news entries accessible from the [Main News Page](index.html) and will reset the page for the next batch.
