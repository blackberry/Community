### More Adoption of Ripple
The adoption of [Ripple](http://github.com/blackberry/ripple-ui) has two recent very visible examples in

### Cleanup: Qt Repo and Gitorious
We are now contributing directly upstream to [Gitorious](http://qt.gitorious.org/qt), and, as a consequence,

Code has been removed but download files will still be here - currently a tad out of date.
