### BlackBerry-Py: Python and BlackBerry 10
[BlackBerry Py](../Python.html) has been making very good progress.  The goal is to support the
development of complete BlackBerry 10 apps, with the UI written using [QML](../QML.html) and
[Cascades](../Cascades.html),
and the “business logic” or back-end code written entirely in Python.  Check out the [Python](../Python.html)
page in the wiki

### Cleanup: Qt Repo and Gitorious
We are now contributing directly upstream to [Gitorious](http://qt.gitorious.org/qt), and, as a consequence,
the [old repo](https://github.com/blackberry/Qt) is, at best, a duplicate.
Code has been removed but download files will still be here - currently a tad out of date.
