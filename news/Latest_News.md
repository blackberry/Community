### Community Port of WebWorks SDK to Linux
Michael Robinson ([@badtoyz](twitter.com/badtoyz)) and Joe Jerde ([@ice2921](twitter.com/ice2921)) have packaged the
BlackBerry 10 WebWorks SDK for Linux.  The port is at
[badtoyz/BB10-WebWorks-SDK-linux](https://github.com/badtoyz/BB10-WebWorks-SDK-Linux).
Looking forward to a pull request to understand the differences and, hopefully, to eventually support Linux.
Also, both Michael and Joe will be listed in the [contributors page](http://blackberry.github.com/approvedSignatories.html).
