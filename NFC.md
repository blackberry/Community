### Description
NFC
([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication),
[NFC forum](http://www.nfc-forum.org/home))
is a set of standards for
smartphones to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together
or bringing them into close proximity.
Communication is also possible between an NFC device and an unpowered NFC chip, called a "tag".
