### Description
Framework to Build Fluid BlackBerry 10 Native Apps.
Cascades leverages the Qt object model, event model, and threading model, using
QtCore, QtXML, QtSql, QtNetwork and QtSensors.
The UI framework it based on an scene graph model and can be programmed at the C++ or QML level.
Cascades includes a rich set of core and advanced controls and is OpenGL-accelerated.

Cascades was previewed initially at [BlackBerry DevCon 2012 Europe][devcon2012_europe]
and then presented in detail at [BlackBerry 10 Jam][bb10jam].

The key web page is the [Cascades Micro-Site](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/).
The site has many useful areas, including:
* [Introduction](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/documentation/getting_started/introtocascades.html)
* [Sample Apps](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/sampleapps)
* [Documentation](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/documentation) - including a [videos area](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/documentation/videos/index.html)
* [Online Reference](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/reference/classes.html)
* [Downloads](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/download)

The main forum for questions is the:

* [Cascades Development Forum](http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Cascades-Development/bd-p/Cascades)

The main tool for authoring Cascades is:

* [Cascades Builder](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/documentation/getting_started/cascades_builder/index.html)

The Cascades Builder is bundled in the QNX Momentics IDE.

### Cascades Samples

Samples are critical to speeding up learning and using new technology.
Whenever possible we release samples under an Open Source license to simplify their use in whatever contexts are most useful
to the developer communities.

A list of the currently available samples is at [Cascades Samples].

### Webinars

The micro-site has a
[videos page](https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/documentation/videos/index.html)
that includes
material, including recordings, on a series of Webinars covering Cascades.  The current list includes
