## Overview

The BlackBerry&reg; Community Wiki is authored collectively by the BlackBerry community.  The wiki covers the following topics:

#### Pages

Pages are short, usually one screenful, overviews of components, technology, or any other topic.
The goal of these pages is to point the reader to the right place where to get more detailed information.
Whenever possible we will want to avoid duplicating information readily available elsewhere.

See [All Pages].

#### Articles

These are longer pieces that cover a topic in detail. See [All Articles]

#### Presentations

Slides from different presentations by RIM and non-RIM employees.  See [All Presentations][all_slides].

#### News

Short news on activities related to BlackBerry Development, with an emphasis on Open Source.  See [All News].

## Work in Progress

As most wikis, this one is very much *Work In Progress* in all fronts, not just the actual content of a given
page but also topics covered, level of detail and format.

The location of this wiki and the technology it uses may change over time, but the content and the contribution
structure will remain the same.

## Under the Covers

The BlackBerry® Community Wiki uses [GitHub Pages](http://help.github.com/pages/)
mostly written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
with templating provided via [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/).
The benefits of this approach over GitHub’s Wiki are [discussed here](http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/General-Open-Source-Topics/Community-Wiki-at-GitHub-Pages-or-Wiki/td-p/1466637).

We use two main repositories: [one](http://github.com/blackberry/Community)
corresponds to the [released Wiki](http://blackberry.github.com/Community)
and the [other](http://github.com/blackberry-community/Community)
corresponds to the [staged Wiki](http://blackberry-community.github.com/Community).
