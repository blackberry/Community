### Overview

([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement)) A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) defines the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to a company/project, typically software under an open source license.

Some Open Source projects use Contribution Agreements; others do not.  Notable amongs those that do are
the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org) and
[RIM's open source projects](http://blackberry.github.com).
The arrangement at ASF is that there is a
[Corporate Contribution Agrement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/ccla.txt) and an
[Individual Contribution Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).
A suscint description of the rationale for the Contribution agreement is
[here](http://apache.org/licenses/#clas).

The arrangement at RIM borrows very heavily from that at Apache.
The contribution process used for RIM's projects at GitHub is described at
[howToContribute.html](http://blackberry.github.com/howToContribute.html);
the list of signatories is at
