### Description

bbUI.js is a WebWorks framework that helps follow the UI recommendations for BlackBerry OS, BlackBerry PlayBook and BlackBerry 10.
The framework started within [WebWorks-Samples][repo:webworks-amples]
but later [became a top project](http://openbbnews.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/bbuijs/).  Tim Neil is the project lead.

Currently the support for BBOS smartphones is more complete than that for PlayBook.  We expect this to change quickly.
