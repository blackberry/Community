### Description

The objective of the bbUI toolkit is to provide a BlackBerry® User Experience and Design Language
for HTML5 applications using the BlackBerry [WebWorks] framework. It provides common UI constructs that
are found on the BlackBerry operating system so that you can create an application that follows
system UI guidelines and looks at home on a BlackBerry with very little effort.

The framework started within [WebWorks-Samples][repo:webworks-amples]
but later [became a top project](http://openbbnews.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/bbuijs/).
The project is an incubation project and [Tim Neil] is the project lead.

Currently the support for BBOS smartphones is more complete than that for PlayBook.  We expect this to change quickly.
