### Description
Adobe Integrated Runtime (Adobe AIR)
([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime),
[Adobe website](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/))
is a cross-platform runtime environment developed by Adobe Systems for
building Applications.

The key web page is the [Micro-Site](http://developer.blackberry.com/air/).
The site has many useful areas, including:
* [Introduction](https://developer.blackberry.com/air/documentation/ww_air_getting_started/Overview_ms_1962887_11.html)
* [Sample Apps](https://developer.blackberry.com/air/sampleapps/)

* [Downloads](https://developer.blackberry.com/air/download)

The main forum for questions is the:

### Beta for BlackBerry 10

The BlackBerry 10 SDK for Adobe AIR beta is now available.  The main entry point is the [Beta Microsite](https://developer.blackberry.com/air/beta/),
which includes links to documentation, tools and more.

### AIR Samples

We keep samples in the [Samples-for-AIR](http://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-AIR) repository at GitHub.  They are available with an Open Source license.

The current list includes:
* [Sample Library](https://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-AIR/tree/master/SampleLibrary) - Sample APIs for common utilities and UI elements such as animated screen transitions, navigation menu, media component, search field, and download manager
* [Sample Application](https://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-AIR/tree/master/SampleApplication) - demonstrates the use of the above library
* [Sample BPS ANE](https://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-AIR/tree/master/SampleBPSANE) - Demonstrates the use of [Native Extensions for Adobe AIR](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/native-extensions-for-air.html) to access the [BlackBerry Platform Services] library.
